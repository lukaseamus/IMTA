# IMTA
This repository contains data and R code accompanying the literature review *Integrating plants improves aquaculture* on the benefits that plants provide in integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems.

The R code needed to perform the meta-analysis and plot the four figures is contained in the `IMTA.R` file.

Data files for each figure:

**Figure 1**
1. `citations.csv`: Web of Science citations report on "IMTA" and "IMTA AND (plant* OR seaweed* OR kelp* OR macroalga* OR alga*)".

2. `findings.csv`: Findings of plant-related IMTA papers categorised into positive, negative and neutral as well as primary purpose of plant integration.

3. `plants.csv`: Groups of plants and their co-cultured animals in IMTA systems referred to in the literature.

**Figure 2**
1. `ammonium.csv`: Reported ammonium uptake (μmol NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> gDW<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) for different macroalgae with initial ammonium concentrations given in μM.

2. `biofiltration.csv`: Difference in biofiltration rate between macroalgae in monoculture and IMTA.

3. `growth.csv`: Difference in growth rate between macroalgae in monoculture and IMTA.

**Figure 3**
1. `production.csv`: Seaweed production in t and income in $ t<sup>-1</sup> for every country producing at least 130 t in 2017 (Reference: http://www.fao.org/3/ca5495t/ca5495t.pdf).

2. `hypoxia.csv`: Coastal zones of hypoxia (Reference: 10.1126/science.1156401).

3. Additional: Required area of seaweed farms to offset finfish and crustacean aquaculture (Reference: 10.1016/j.cub.2019.07.041) and change in mean sea surface temperature between present time and 2100 according to RCP8.5 (Reference: https://www.bio-oracle.org/downloads-to-email.php)

**Figure 4**
1. `countries.csv`: Seaweed production (Reference: http://www.fao.org/3/ca5495t/ca5495t.pdf) and number of papers (Web of Science) for all countries producing at least 130 t of seaweed and contributing to the scientific literature on plant-related IMTA.

2. `seaweeds.csv`: Seaweed production (Reference: http://www.fao.org/3/i9540en/i9540en.pdf) and number of papers (Web of Science) for all seaweeds that have a global production of at least 34×10<sup>3</sup> t and appear in the scientific literature on plant-related IMTA.
